# time-series-data-packer-rs
Time series data packer written in Rust language

## Motivations
In a lot of my IoT projects, I have a pressure on storage size after time series data collection with miliseconds precission.
Yes, I'm using OPen Sourece greate data warehouses and inside engines do a lot of work for me, but one day I decided to find better - my own - way to time series data compressions.
This is an experimental project with saving storage size for time series data connected to specific domains (not random data for sure).

## TBD
